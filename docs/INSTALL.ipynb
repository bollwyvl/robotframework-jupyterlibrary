    "Installing `JupyterLibrary` will bring along Robot Framework and SeleniumLibrary. Jupyter components, like `notebook`, `jupyterlab` and `nteract_on_jupyter`, and browser executors (e.g. `chromedriver`, `geckodriver`) and various utilities (e.g. `nodejs`) are up to you, depending on what you want to test. Here are some examples."
